                        Setting in time when the advanced technology allows
                        humans to survive without the needs for food consumption,
                        people no longer rely on stock farming and killing animals for
                        protein sources; however, livestock has been domesticated by
                        humans for almost as long as humanity has existed, they're no
                        longer equipped the survival skills to search for food out in the
                        wild.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        At the same time, the shift toward augmented reality in
                        people's day-to-day lives contributes to the descend of new
                        developments in 3-dimensional space. As a result, future
                        developments normally resort to two methods, and they're
                        either minimal building structure or reiteration of the historical
                        past to cut down costs.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Accordingly, people are urged to reimagine a humane way
                        to manage the massive population of animal refugees. It forces
                        the emersion of the Monumental Landscape, which is a place
                        that ensures the last generation livestock will not go extinct due
                        to the lack of food sources or a safe place to live.
                        Because most former slaughterhouse locations have
                        gone out of business, the facilities that once held the animals
                        captivated will be repurposed and be used to house the
                        livestock. In addition, it'll also become an amusement park
                        where people can experience the true 3-dimensional space.
                        There are 3 forms of livestock included in the park: The
                        Preservation, The Pet, and The Virtual Realistic. The Preservation
                        is the first generation livestock living in the park. The Pets are
                        the second generation of farm livestock. These animals are
                        genetically modified to be smaller and better accommodate
                        the normal household's living conditions. And lastly, The Virtual
                        Realistic are animals people imitate to create active interaction
                        between human and animals in the park.

                        Rustbelt includes many neighborhoods that once relied on manufacturing business, slowly losing their identities due to manufacturing jobs sourcing oversea. The lack of community identity - an economic replacement attributed to the continuous stagnant economy. The area was suppressed and generation with higher education seemed loath to return. As a result, these towns fell into an infinite cycle of economic depression. In collaboration with Designer Harry Allan and Corning GlassLab, this design - the Warmth reintroduces Rustbelt area. Partnering with Christian Van Luven, the owner of the Syracuse local Roji Tea Lounge, as an attempt to celebrate Chris's effort of rejuvenating the Rustbelt area, and cultivating local businesses, a tea set is designed to support Chris's devotion for tea culture and to emphasize the concept that opening local businesses is a practical solution to the economy of The Rustbelt.

                        To develop strategies of re-imagining a new kind of city full of promise and potential. This design aim to use tea as a media to link people's five sense, and provide a complete experience. The business concept of Roji is to provide people with a sense of home feeling. And through this, it allows people to be more adventurous and get comfortable with trying new things. In addition, Roji also offers nightlife without the bar scene, often attracting a packed house and local music. The ideal shape of the cup coincides with the natural glass blowing shape, as it creates the shape similar to a water drop. To serve the purpose of drinking, Cutting the top of the “water drop”, it leaves a flat rim as the cup opening. The concept is that starting from the rim of the water drop shape cup form, it will be covered with white frosted texture. Following the change of contour, frosted white texture will gently fade away. This gradient symbolizes the change of temperature, which shows the stage from frozen to warmness. As for the coaster, the use of concrete gives it a grounded foundation, which help to balance of the lightness of glass cup.
