            <p class="description-paragraph">
                The project illustrates an attempt to rejuvenate a slaughterhouse
                into an animal/ human resort in a future era when the differences
                between virtual reality and reality are indistinguishable and humans no
                longer require meat for nutrition intake.The slaughterhouse represents
                the permanent quality in architecture and how architecture has the
                ability to withstand time tangibly. Yet, the special characteristics of the
                time period have predetermined that tangibility is not the only form of
                reality. Moreover, the rejuvenation process incites the contemplation
                of whether the built structure with long lifespans is necessary or just
                another form of imprisonment, since the lingering spirit continuously
                evoking the detrimental association to brutality and death.

            <br>
            <br>

                Setting in time when the advanced technology allows
                humans to survive without the needs for food consumption,
                people no longer rely on stock farming and killing animals for
                protein sources; however, livestock has been domesticated by
                humans for almost as long as humanity has existed, they're no
                longer equipped the survival skills to search for food out in the
                wild.

            <br>
            <br>

                At the same time, the shift toward augmented reality in
                people's day-to-day lives contributes to the descend of new
                developments in 3-dimensional space. As a result, future
                developments normally resort to two methods, and they're
                either minimal building structure or reiteration of the historical
                past to cut down costs.

            <br>
            <br>

                Accordingly, people are urged to reimagine a humane way
                to manage the massive population of animal refugees. It forces
                the emersion of the Monumental Landscape, which is a place
                that ensures the last generation livestock will not go extinct due
                to the lack of food sources or a safe place to live.
                Because most former slaughterhouse locations have
                gone out of business, the facilities that once held the animals
                captivated will be repurposed and be used to house the
                livestock. In addition, it'll also become an amusement park
                where people can experience the true 3-dimensional space.
                There are 3 forms of livestock included in the park: The
                Preservation, The Pet, and The Virtual Realistic. The Preservation
                is the first generation livestock living in the park. The Pets are
                the second generation of farm livestock. These animals are
                genetically modified to be smaller and better accommodate
                the normal household's living conditions. And lastly, The Virtual
                Realistic are animals people imitate to create active interaction
                between human and animals in the park.
